their audio aura, based on the average of the energy, danceability, and valence of their top 100 song, would be purple since their average danceability is quite high at 0.716
and energy at 0.655.
however this way of calculating and trying to represent the listener audio aura may not be accurate as i am using the data of a subjectively given value and a larger sample size would be needed
to make a better a conclusion.
more consideration should be accounted for like the genre they listen to, and whether there are bias towards a certain area of mood aura just because they like a certain artist work and that artist tends to do a certain type of music
