                                            How do you know?: out of the 3 sorting algorithm, bubble algorithm is the only 1 that have the
                                            time needed to sort to not remain constant in the best and worst case scenario. the differences
                                            between the best case and worst case scenario is also the most noticable here just like in the
                                            algorithm pattern/formula of being n and n squared.

                                    How do you know?: out of the process of elimination the merge sort is either sort 2 or sort 3 and since
                                    merge sort usually outperform selection sort out of all scenario, and sort 2 outperform sort 3 in all
                                    scenario, then by process of elimination this is merge sort.

                                    How do you know?:although this outperform sort1 on certain scenario, when talking about the best case
                                    scenario which is the sorted file, it clearly looses to sort1 as suggested by the algorithm pattern
                                    of selection and bubble sorting. anotherthing worth mentioning is that on all 3 scenario the time
                                    it takes are all constant just like what the selection sort suggests.
